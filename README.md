#### Why we need explainability & interpretibility?

Essential for:
1. Model debugging - Why did my model make a mistake? How can I improve the accuracy of the model?
2. Detecting fairness issues - Is my model biased? If yes, where?
3. Human-AI cooperation - How can I understand and trust the model's decisions?
4. Regulatory compliance - Does my model satisfy legal & regulatory requirements?
5. High-risk applications - Healthcare, Financial Services, FinTech, Judicial, Security etc,.

```
* **Jupyter Notebook**: You can also install explainx via Jupyter Notebook. Just run the following command:

```python
!pip install explainx
```

## Usage

Once you have install explainX, you can simply follow the example below to use it:

Import **explainx**

```python
from explainx import *
```

Load dataset as X_Data, Y_Data in your XGBoost Model

```python
#X_Data = Pandas DataFrame
#Y_Data = Numpy Array or List

X_Data, Y_Data = explainx.dataset_boston()

#Train Model
model = xgboost.train({"learning_rate": 0.01}, xgboost.DMatrix(X_Data, label=Y_Data), 100)
```

One line of code to **use the explainx module**

```python
explainx.ai(X_Data, Y_Data, model, model_name="xgboost")
```

Click on the link to view the dashboard.

```jupyter
App running on https://0.0.0.0:8080
```
**Running ExplainX on the cloud e.g., AWS Sagemaker?** **https://0.0.0.0:8080** will not work. You would need to open the **terminal** and run the following command.

```jupyter
lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p [port number]
```
```jupyter
lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p 8080
```
